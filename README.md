Training Alcohol Dataset with Linear Regression and Random Forest classifiers

The project or study is based on the Alcohol dataset. The dataset has a wide range of information regarding various Alcoholic and Non Alcoholic drinks with their manufacturing country, ABV(Alcohol by volume), Tasting Notes, Category it belongs to, Rating, Number of ratings received, Tasting notes, Food pairing, Suggested Temperature to serve, Price and Description. The dataset contains 33885 records after initial cleaning. Machine Learning classifiers have been built and implemented on the dataset after splitting the data into train and test proportions respectively. The train test split is done to train the data perfectly and then checking it on the test data to calculate the accuracy of the model. The dataset can be used to study the correlation between the alcohol percentage and its price. The machine learning model is made to train and understand the relation mainly  between ABV and its pricing. The training further helps the model to predict prices based in the ABV of the alcohol.
